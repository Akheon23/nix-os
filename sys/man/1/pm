.SH DESCRIPTION
.I PM 
is a package management system inspired by
.IR contrib
and
.IR 9pm ,
but with greater focus on speed and maintainability. Packages are stored as
.B .tgz
files on an HTTP server, rather than as discrete files on sources, for improved speed. Packages do not install sources to
.B /sys/src;
rather, sources are placed in 
.B /contrib/src,
to keep the
.B /sys/src
tree clean.
.PP
Packages are described by a category and a name. Categories include 
.I devel,
.I lib,
and
.I network.
Package names include
.I mercurial,
.I openssl,
and
.I openssh.
A full accounting of categories may be obtained by simply listing the directories in
.IR /contrib/packages/ .
Listing of individual packages is accomplished through the
.B pm/list
command.
.TP
.I pm/install 
Installs the package and any necessary dependencies. The specified package will be automatically downloaded using the
.B pm/pull
command, as will any dependencies.
.TP
.I pm/list
List the available packages, one per line, with no additional description, suitable for further processing. The
.B -i
option gives a listing of all currently installed packages. The
.B -v
option gives a description of each package. If a category is specified, only packages under that category are listed.
.TP
.I pm/pull
Download the specified package from the package repository. This is not necessary for installation tasks, but may be of interest if you wish to examine the package prior to installing.
.TP
.I pm/clean
Removes downloaded files for the specified package, to save space.
.TP
.I pm/depclean
Cleans up the specified packages and all of its dependencies, recursively.
.TP
.I pm/remove
Deletes files installed by the specified package. Does not remove dependency packages, as they may be needed by other packages.
